			<h4>Linked House</h4>
			<p>
				It's online storage for favorite links (bookmarks). <strong>Currently not supporting mobile browsers / devices</strong>, but I plan to integrate it with them.
			</p>
			<p>
				The development of this application is started long time ago and the arhitecture is not very well. It contains good code and bad code. Since client-side including only jQuery and the project isn't too small - it's not so easy for a single developer to make serious changes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Actually this is the fully rewritten project from scratch. The first project had almost the same idea, but it was started when my skills were on initial phase.

			<h4>Writing speed calculator</h4>
			<p>
				It's a little application which was made for less than 4 days. It just calculates typing speed and show results such as - characters / words per minute and scores. It uses jQuery and it's most client-side oriented. Results are not saved, but in the future I will made some server-side storage for the best results.
